# Architecture

Living structural map of the system as of 2026-10-16.
Overwritten when structural changes occur during a session.

## Overview
CatchLogX is a Next.js 16.0 web application for BOKU Wien's hydrobiology department.
It manages fish catch data via Excel upload, SQL querying, and visualization.
Stack: Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL, Tailwind CSS v4, NextAuth.js v4.
Infrastructure: PostgreSQL 16 + MinIO via Docker Compose.

## Deployment Topology
- **Local development** — `docker compose up -d` (PostgreSQL 16 + MinIO + app container), app on port 3001.
- **Production (BOKU)** — desktop-class machine on Martin Seebacher's desk (institute IT, OE-level) inside the BOKUnet, productive since June 2026, so far accredited only informally by email. Maintenance access is deliberately restricted to university-sanctioned paths — see `DECISIONS.md` ("No self-managed maintenance tunnels into the BOKUnet") and #115. No standing tunnel, VPN bridge, or reverse tunnel may be attached to this machine.
- **Public instance `catchlogx.graf.priv.at`** — CNAME to `claw.graf.priv.at` (Georg's own VPS). nginx on 443 terminates TLS (Let's Encrypt, renewed by certbot) and reverse-proxies to `127.0.0.1:40873`; the backing Next.js server is not running yet, so the vhost currently answers `502`. The students deploy their copy here, and a second self-hosted GitHub Actions runner is planned on this machine (#123). The nginx vhost and the deploy tree live in the claw deployment tree (SVN), not in this repo.

## Data Model
```
User ──< Session             (custom auth)
User ──< Uploads             (excel upload tracking)
User ──< UserQueries          (saved SQL queries)
UploadStates: UPLOADED | ACCEPTED | REJECTED | DB_ERROR | SAVED_IN_DB
PasswordResetStates: REQUESTED | EXPIRED | DONE

DummyFiles                    (MinIO dummy upload metadata)

RiverSite ──< Sampling ──< FishCatch ── FishSpecies
FishCatch: added pitDec, pitHex, recapture fields for PIT tag tracking
```

## Auth Flow
```
LoginForm (client)
  → POST /api/auth/sign-in { username, password }
  → services/authService.ts
  → bcrypt.compare() against User.hashedPassword
  → creates Session row (32-byte hex token, 30-day expiry)
  → sets httpOnly cookie "session-token"
  → returns { user }
  → AuthProvider.setUser(user)

Page load (client)
  → AuthProvider calls GET /api/auth/session
  → reads cookie, looks up Session (incl. user)
  → returns { authenticated: true, user } or { authenticated: false }

Protected route (client)
  → ProtectedRoute checks AuthProvider.isAuthenticated
  → router.replace(/login) if unauthenticated

API route (server)
  → requireAuth() calls getSessionUser() from lib/session.ts
  → returns 401 if no valid session-token cookie

Admin API route (server + edge)
  → middleware.ts checks session-token cookie existence on /api/admin/*
  → lib/admin-middleware.ts checks role === "admin" from session
```

## Startup Order
1. `docker compose up -d db minio minio-init` (PostgreSQL + MinIO)
2. Set `DATABASE_URL` and MinIO env vars in `.env`
3. `npx prisma generate`
4. `npx prisma db push`
5. `npm run create-user` (optional: + seed scripts)
6. `npm run dev`
